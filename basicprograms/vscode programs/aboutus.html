          <div id="section3" class="container-fluid text-dark p-3"><h5>Our Team<br><hr>
            <img src="section3.jpg" width="300px" class="rounded float-end">Our team of highly skilled and experienceed professionals help us in 
            attainment of a number of the firm's targets, predefined. THE team, for reasons of better and
            highly effective management of operationalunits.These units, in the most 
            effective and efficient manner, boosts the firm's productionn capacity. The division of these 
            professionals is done as per their area of expertise. Futher,regular training sessions are 
            provided, for maximum employee satisfication.
            A key pillar of the industrial revolution, a foundation of
             modern civilisation, was the division of labour. And that’s just another way to say teamwork.

            Employee teamwork enables your workforce to:<br>
            
            Split difficult tasks into simpler ones, then work together to complete them faster<br>
            Develop specialised skills, so that the best person for each task can do it better and faster.
          <br>For any task or problem, there are usually countless solutions. When one employee tackles a project, 
          they might be able to think of a few different ideas given time. 
          But when a team tackles a problem, the project benefits from multiple perspectives, skillsets,
           and experiences all at once.

          A team approach can therefore lead to faster, deeper innovation.
        <br>
        Imagine you have a workforce of 10 designers all working in separate rooms. Each designer works to
         their own strengths and suffers from their own weaknesses, with nobody to teach or learn from.

        Now put them all in the same room, on the same project. Working together, they’ll soon learn each
         other’s strengths and correct each other’s mistakes. And everyone’s performance will improve.</h5></div>
